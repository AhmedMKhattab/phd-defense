## 📌 Title  
**Personalizing Type 2 Diabetes Risk Prediction**



## 🧠 In Plain English  
I built a smarter, faster way to catch type 2 diabetes early — combining genetic risk and machine learning to reach people current tools miss.   
The goal is simple: **earlier detection, better outcomes, lower costs.**


## 🔍 What’s the problem?
Current diabetes screening tools miss people who are truly at risk — and flag many who aren’t.

## 💡 What did I do?
I built a smarter way to screen for type 2 diabetes using:

- Genetic risk scores (PRS)
- Machine learning
- Real-world data from diverse populations

## 🚀 Why It Matters  
- Detects more people at risk — earlier  
- Works across **diverse, real-world populations**  
- Saves money


## 🔑 One-Line Takeaway  
**Smarter screening saves lives and money.**
