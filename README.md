## 📌 Title  
**Personalizing Type 2 Diabetes Risk Prediction**

---

## 🧠 In Plain English  
I built a smarter, faster way to catch type 2 diabetes early — combining genetic risk and machine learning to reach people current tools miss. The goal is simple: **earlier detection, better outcomes, lower costs.**

---

## 💡 Why It Matters  
- More cases caught earlier — especially in people not flagged by current screening  
- Works across **diverse, real-world populations**  
- Scalable, open-source, and **cost-effective**

---

## 🔑 One-Line Takeaway  
**Smarter screening saves money and lives.**
