## 📌 Title  
**Personalizing Type 2 Diabetes Risk Prediction**
A Machine Learning Approach Integrating Genetics, Phenotypes, and Real-World Data

## 🔍 What’s the problem?
Current diabetes screening tools follow a "one-size fits all" approach and miss people who are truly at risk.


## 💡 What did I do?
I built a **tailored screening tool** that adapts to your:

- 🧬 **Genetics**
- 🩺 **Health history**
- 🏃 **Lifestyle**

Powered by **machine learning** and tested on **diverse, real-world populations.**


## 🚀 Why It Matters  
- Finds high-risk individuals **earlier**
- Works across **diverse ethnicities**
- Reduces wasted costs on unnecessary testing  
- Paves the way for **person-centered, genetically-informed public health**


## 🔑 One-Line Takeaway  
**Tailored screening saves lives — and cuts costs.**
